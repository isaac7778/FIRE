## Codebase

Since we did experiments on diverse domains (vision, language, rl), we used different codebase and environment. Please refer below:

#### Continual Visual Learning (Fig 2) > [vision/README.md](vision/README.md)

#### Continual Pretraining of LLMs (Fig 3) > [language/README.md](language/README.md)

#### Reinforcement Learning (Fig 4) > [rl/dqn/README.md](rl/dqn/README.md) and [rl/sac/README.md](rl/sac/README.md)
