## 📖 Codebase

As we conducted experiments in diverse domains (vision, language and RL), we used different settings for each of them. Please refer below to set up and run experiments:

#### Continual Visual Learning (Fig 2) > [vision/README.md](vision/README.md)

#### Continual Pretraining of LLMs (Fig 3) > [language/README.md](language/README.md)

#### Reinforcement Learning (Fig 4) > [rl/dqn/README.md](rl/dqn/README.md) and [rl/sac/README.md](rl/sac/README.md)
